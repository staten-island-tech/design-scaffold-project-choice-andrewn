  <h1>CAREER</h1>
<h2 class="gen-text">     Turn back now.  You have no future with us.  If you linger on this webpage, you won’t have a future at all.  At Shop Shaq, our workers put blood, sweat, and tears (and occasionally other bodily fluids) into each dish that leaves our "kitchen".  As a company and in the words of our CEO, “we hate our customers, our workers, and ourselves.”  Our morals are nonexistent and we are not responsible for your wellbeing, and if you’re still reading this, we’re not sure if you are either.
